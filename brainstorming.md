CodePath: iOS 101 - App Brainstorming
===

## New App Ideas - List
1. Social Workout Tracker
    - Allows users to track workouts (date, time, duration, exercises, sets, reps, weight, etc.). Connect with others to view their workouts, compare statistics, and more.
2. Book Tracker
    - Book tracking app geared toward those who don't already love reading. The app allows for setting goals (daily pages read, number of books in a year etc.) and creates a customizable plan to reach the goal. The app tracks users' progress, like reading streaks and encourages them to continue (think Duolingo). Social features allow you to connect with friends, compare reading habits with other users, and create book clubs.
3. Credit Card Rewards Flight Tool
    - Tool for user to find the optimal way they can spend their credit card reward points on flights. User can specify their credit card lender and browse the cost (in points) of flights with both the lender's partner airlines, as well as those in the same aliance as the partner airlines. 
4. Safari Extension for Intentional Browsing
    - Mobile Safari extension bundled in an iOS app that hides distracting short-form content like YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and Facebook Stories from their web versions. Users can toggle specific filters, track their progress, etc.

## Evaluation
1. Social Workout Tracker
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is central to the experience. Users are likely logging workouts at the gym or immediately after, which makes a desktop interface impractical. Push notifications reinforce streaks, real-time updates from friends keep engagement high, and potential integration with sensors or HealthKit could add even more mobile-specific value. This app is genuinely mobile-native—not just a website in an app wrapper.
   - **Story:** The value prop is clear and relatable: track workouts, stay accountable, and get motivated by seeing what your friends are doing. The social layer fills a real gap in the fitness app space. People already screenshot workouts or stats to share in group chats—this app formalizes that behavior. It’s an idea that would make immediate sense to your peers and has viral potential within fitness-focused communities.
   - **Market:** The broader fitness app market is huge, but this app targets a specific niche: people who strength train regularly and care about tracking progress. Within that niche, the value is strong and the alternatives are weak—most apps are either solo-only or cardio-centric. This won't be a mass-market app out of the gate, but it's well-positioned to dominate a high-engagement subset of users.
   - **Habit:** Very strong habit potential. Serious users will log every workout, check the feed often, and look for feedback from friends. Logging becomes part of the post-set ritual. Users aren’t just consuming content—they're actively creating it with every workout. Add in streaks, PR notifications, or light competition, and you've got a tight feedback loop that encourages daily or near-daily engagement.
   - **Scope:** The MVP is clean and achievable. Logging, a social feed, and user accounts are technically straightforward. You don’t need advanced features (charts, leaderboards, social challenges) to ship something useful. Even a stripped-down version would feel rewarding to use. The product is clearly scoped and realistically buildable within the program timeline.

2. Credit Card Rewards Flight Tool
    -  **Mobile:** Mobile adds convenience, but isn’t essential. Users could just as easily use this tool on a desktop, especially since flight planning is not usually done on the go. There’s no strong use of mobile-native features like camera, location, or sensors.
    -  **Story:** The app solves a clear and frustrating problem—figuring out how to maximize credit card points for flights. It's especially valuable for frequent travelers or points hobbyists, and the benefit is easy to explain: save money by using points more strategically.
    -  **Market:** The market includes millions of credit card users, but the core audience is a niche: those who travel regularly and care about optimizing rewards. Within that niche, the value is high, especially for users juggling multiple cards or airline programs.
    -  **Habit:** Usage is infrequent but meaningful. Most users will engage a few times per trip or during travel planning phases. It’s not habit-forming in a daily sense, but it delivers high value per session. It’s a tool, not a community or content platform.
    -  **Scope:** The core product is well-defined and feasible: input a card, browse flight options with partner and alliance carriers, and compare point costs. It’s mostly a data integration and UI challenge. A simple version is valuable and technically achievable.
